          If you're looking for a junior level to-do apps, just reach out to me.
          I'll be more than happy to code you one live. Older stuff at the
          bottom. No recent projects, since I like to actually enjoy life
          outside of work hours. Would love to work on some of these though
          (React pdf renderer).
